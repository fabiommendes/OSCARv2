# History

This file describes the history of editions and strategies used to evolve OSCAR 
code.

## Consolidate Python 2 code (doing)

Create new non-stochastic and single-run tests. Default test run at rate of one
test every 1m:12s.

Consolidate all files into a single script to avoid problems with readfile() 
when converting to Python 3. At this point, code cannot execute runs with 
different parameters anymore.  

## Convert to Python 3

## Extract data

## Instrumentation and tests

## Modularize

## Split functionalities into classes

## Create plugabble classes

## Optimize with Cython
